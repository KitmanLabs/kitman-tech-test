# kitman-tech-test
Mobile coding challenge

## Challenge

The base challenge is to create a small app with a basic login along with a view that displays a list of athletes along with an athlete details screen. The UI isn't expected to be beautiful as it's a tech test, not an art piece, but give consideration to UX and general app flow.

The exact end product is up to you, you will have access to athlete's squads so if you find a way to utilise that, even better.

Spend no more than a day working on it, we understand this is your free time and don't want to take up any more than necessary.

Use this as an opportunity to showcase your own engineering values along with what you feel are important aspects of mobile app development. While you possibly won't be able to include everything you wanted, make the most of what you can and tell us what you would've like to of added or expanded given more time. 

You can use what ever libraries you feel necessary.

**Delieverable**

* Ideally a Github/bitbucket link to a repo containing the app. If that's not possible, send over a full runnable zip of the project/workspace.
